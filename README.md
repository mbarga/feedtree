This is the beginning of a small project to bring visualization to streams from the Feedly news aggregator. I have been a fan of newstree.jp which applies a visual tree structure to google news articles. I wanted to accomplish the same thing on my personal news aggregation service.

- set environment variables PYTHONPATH; FEEDLY_CLIENT_SECRET
- default looks for mongodb to be installed and running on localhost:27017 (runserver.py will not work)
- check for the most recent feely sandbox secret (on the forum)
- start feely_connect.py
- access localhost:8080/auth and sign in to get the token
